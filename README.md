## Tensorflow Ticket Resolution Predictor
This project will help to predict the possible resolution of a ticket; helping to estimate the effort, improving resource allocation and reducing business impact. 
Scope and Purpose

### Purpose
Most of the critical issues are handled and tracked in the form of tickets in a typical IT environment. IT infrastructure is a group of components connected in a network. So, when a part goes down, it takes many other components along with it. It may even take days to figure out what went wrong and find the root cause. So, it is essential to notify the component owners.  

The scope is the prototyping of an ML-based process to associate the reported issue to a previous incident or service request and predict a solution. This prediction will be used by ServiceDesk to determine the best course of action, including Support team and critic. The target is to identify the potential solution for the 20–30% of incident tickets routed to the incorrect team with the wrong priority.

### Scope
This phase associates understanding of the problem and exploration of the data. Evaluating the model and start training the model to assess which approach produces the best metrics. In parallel, while training and evaluation are happening, I will be communicating data insights with my stakeholders.
